# variables are ways of storing data to use later, modify,
# or use multiple times.

# variables are defined in Python as:
variable_name = "value"
# In this case, the value is a 'string', or a set of characters,
# which you can see by the "double quotes"

# variables can also equal numbers
integer = 4
number_with_decimals = 9.17

# the last simple type variables can equal is a boolean: True or False
this_variable_is_true = True
this_variable_is_false = False

# Naming can be quite important. Try to make your variable names
# full words or phrases. If you want your variable to include more
# than one word use an underscore, or "_", to combine them.

# Forbidden Characters: Some characters will result in errors when used
# in a variable name. Spaces will lead Python to believe you have finished
# your name and are moving on. Do not use any special symbols, as these are
# usually reserved for other purposes and will result in an error. Other than
# that you are free to use both upper- and lowercase letters, and if you really
# want to use a number make sure you use it in combination with letters and not
# as the first character in a name.

# Forbidden Names: Some names are reserved by the Python Language.
# These include, but are not limited to: list, dict, class, int, str,
# bool, if, for, in, while, except, continue, finally, else, try, True, False.
# Using these can lead to straight errors or really weird behavior.
